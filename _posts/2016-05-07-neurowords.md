## Week 1
* **nucleus**
a central point around which matter is gathered. Groups of nerve cells or masses of gray matter within in the central nervous systems are known as nuclei.
L. nucleus - a little kernel
* **gyrus**
a circular convolution. The brain is made up of many circular convolutions, gyri, which have been given identifying names.
G. gyros - circle

* rostral
towards the front, beak of the body.
L. rostrum - beak

* sagittal
direction in an antero-posterior plane, which is the direction which would be taken by an arrow passing through the body from front to back. Some apply a more restrictive definition whereby the path of the arrow determines a single plane passing between the eyes, resulting in only one sagittal plane. All other planes parallel to this one areparasagittal.
L. sagitta - arrow

## Week 2
* **neocortex**

G. neo - new; L. cortex - rind
 
* **parietal**
pertaining to or forming a wall. The parietal lobe lies between the frontal and occipital lobes.

L. pons - bridge
 
* **pineal**
pine cone shaped. The pineal body looks like a pine cone.
L. pineus - pine cone
 
* **dura mater**

L. durus - hard; mater - mother
 
* **quadrigemina**
fourfold, having four symmetrical parts. The corpora quadrigemina are four symmetrical hill-like bodies at the dorsum of the midbrain. They are also known as the superior and inferior colliculi.

a small strap or rein. The habenula is the strap-like connection from the pineal body to the diencephalon. The habenula of the pineal body is sometimes called the peduncle of the pineal body. At one time the pineal body was believed to be the seat of the soul . It was believed to ride upon the brain as a rider rides a horse and to exert control over the brain via the reins, habenula.
L. habenula - a little strap or rein, diminutive of habena - strap, rein
 
* **reticular**
The reticular formation is a netlike system of fibers and cells in the brain stem.
L. reticulum - a little net, a fishnet
 
* **tectum**
the roof of the midbrain. The dorsal aspect of the midbrain containing the nuclei of thequadrigeminal bodies is like a roof over the cerebral aqueduct and the rest of the midbrain; it is called a tectum.
L. tectum - roof

## Week 5
* **ependyma**
The lining membrane of the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord,is the ependyma.
G. ependyma - upper garment
 
* **dura mater**
hard or tough membrane. The dura mater is one of the meninges. The Arabians believed the meninges gave rise to all the membranes of the body, hence the term mater, meaning mother.
L. durus - hard; mater - mother
 
* **pachymeninx**
dura mater.  The tough fibrous membrane covering the brain and the spinal cord.  It is the outermost of the three meninges.
from Latin combining form pachy-  thick, massive, or "abnormally thick" ; G. μῆνιγγ-,μῆνιγξ for membrane
 
* **artery**
blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to tissues (with pulmonary and umbilical exceptions).
from ancient G. ἀρτηρία (artēria) for air ducts.  The ancients did not realize that blood flowed through the arteries and veins, and instead thought that these vessels conveyed air after branching off of the trachea. The trachea was thus later known as the Latinartēria aspera for wind pipe + rough (cartilaginous rings)

## Week 7
 
* **paleo**
prefix meaning old in the evolutionary scale. Paleo is not as old as the more primitivearchi.
G. paleos - old
 
* **piriform or pyriform**
shaped like a pear. The piriform lobe of the brain, medial to the temporal lobe, has a pear shape to it.
L. pirum - pear forma - shape
 
## Week 8 (Auditory and Visual lab)
 
* **tectum**
the roof of the midbrain. The dorsal aspect of the midbrain containing the nuclei of the quadrigeminal bodies is like a roof over the cerebral aqueduct and the rest of the midbrain; it is called a tectum.
