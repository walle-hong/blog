#Notes
##Overview
[This paper](http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/content/28/2/139.full.pdf) is a nice paper in terms of reviewing ultrasound biosafty. What's more, it introduces the FDA requriments of different ultrasound equiments, including diagnositc ultrasound and nondiagnostic ultrasound equipments.
##Concepts
This paper clarifies some concepts which I have been confused with. For future review, all the important concepts are listed below.
- Acoustic power: The rate of energy production, which unit is 1 J/s
- Acoustic intensity: The rate of energy flowing through a unit area (watts per square centimeter)
- FDA limits: For diagnositc ultrasound, the spatial-peaks temporal-average intensity (I_SPTA) less than 720 mW/cm2, which depends on output power, pulse repetition frequency, etc,.
- TI and MI
..* TI refers to thermal index, defined as the ratio of the emitted acoustic power to the power required to raise the temperature of tissue by 1C. The higher TI value, the higher risk of ultrasound to tissue. 
..* MI refers to mechanical index, defined as the maximum value of the peak negative pressure divided by the square root of the acoustic center frequency, which depends on the derated peak rarefactional pressure.
- Acoustic intensity output measurement parameters
..* Spatial-peak temporal-peak (I_SPTP): The highest intensity measured at any point in the ultrasound beam and at any time; it is the highest value of the measured intensities (more closely related to potential mechanical bioef- fects and cavitation).
..* Spatial-peak pulse-average (I_SPPA): The highest intensity measured at any point in the ultrasound beam averaged over the temporal (time) duration of the pulse.
..* Spatial-peak temporal-average (I_SPTA): The highest intensity measured at any point in the ultrasound beam averaged over the pulse repetition period (more closely related to the magnitude of thermal bioeffects)
..* Spatial-average temporal-peak (I_SATP): The average intensity over a selected area, such as the transducer face, but at the peak in time.
..* Spatial-average pulse-average (I_SAPA): The average intensity over a selected area, such as the transducer face, averaged over the temporal duration of pulse.
..* Spatial-average temporal-average (I_SATA): The average intensity over a selected area, such as the transducer face, averaged over the pulse repetition period; this measure- ment of intensity is frequently quoted and is the lowest value of the measures of intensity.
